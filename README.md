**Background Context**
This project focuses on customer segmentation in the retail industry using clustering techniques to enhance marketing efficiency. The dataset consists of global e-commerce transactions, capturing customer behavior through features such as purchase frequency, recency, order value, and loyalty indicators. Segmenting customers based on behavioral patterns enables businesses to deliver more personalized marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and allocate resources more effectively.

#Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an unsupervised learning pipeline that segments customers into distinct groups based on behavioral and transactional data. The approach involves performing data cleaning, feature engineering, and clustering using methods such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. Key metrics such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) were used to uncover customer profiles and guide targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Outcomes**
 - Customer segmentation was performed to identify distinct behavioral patterns within the company's dataset.

 - The optimal number of customer groups was determined to be five, based on the elbow method, silhouette score, and confirmed through hierarchical clustering.

 - Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE were used to visualize the clusters, showing clear separation and validating cluster quality.

 - Boxplots were created to analyze key purchasing metrics across segments, providing actionable insights for developing targeted marketing strategies.



**Showcased Skills**
 - Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Cleaned raw transaction data and derived features such as recency, frequency, and monetary value.

 - Unsupervised Machine Learning: Applied K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to segment customers based on behavioral patterns.

 - Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization: Used PCA and t-SNE to improve cluster separation and support insights through clear visual representations.

 - Business Insight Communication: Interpreted cluster characteristics to inform marketing decisions and customer relationship strategies.
